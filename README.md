## Log

- 3/22 - Refactored to use Parcel instead of crusty old create-react-app, updated some of the skills.

## Installation

- Clone the repo

- With Node installed, run `npm i` to install all necessary node_modules.

- Run `npm run build` to create a build of the app.

- You can run the app locally with `npm run dev`; it should prompt you with the address after building.
